# Rail-Energy-Modeling

The Rail Energy Modeling Software is a Windows program that enables users to investigate fuel savings and emissions reductions in locomotive powertrain technologies. The software allows users to define different train types (e.g. passenger, freight, switch), powertrain types (e.g. engine electric, engine battery hybrid), and drive cycles to compare simulated fuel consumptions and emissions of different train architectures.

Powertrain simulation, done to assist with vehicle design, is common in the automotive and trucking industry and made accessible through reasonably priced software tools (such as ADVISOR, PSAT, AUTONOMIE, AVL Cruise). The Rail Energy Modeling Software is a attempt to bring a similar toolset to the rail industry.

This software builds using Visual Studio 2010 or a built version is included in this repo for downloading [Rail-Energy-Modeling.zip](https://github.com/FleetCarma/Rail-Energy-Modeling/blob/master/Rail-Energy-Modeling.zip)
